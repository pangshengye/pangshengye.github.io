<section id="about-me">

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Engineering and Science at Shanghai University, affiliated with the <a href='https://scdm-shu.github.io'> SCDM </a> research team. 

In 2024, I obtained my PhD from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor <a href='https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/0001038/'> Jianwei Yin </a> and co-supervised by Researcher <a href='https://person.zju.edu.cn/zjuzxk'> Xinkui Zhao </a>. My primary research focuses on service computing and edge-cloud computing, with a particular emphasis on pricing, transaction, and optimization scheduling of web services in service network environments. 

For students who are interested in joining our research group as a Master’s student or intern, please feel free to contact me at pangsy \[AT\] shu [dot] edu [dot] cn.
